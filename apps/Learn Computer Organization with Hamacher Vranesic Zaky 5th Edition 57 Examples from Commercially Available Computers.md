The book is divided into ten chapters, each covering a major topic in computer organization. The first chapter introduces the basic structure of computer hardware and software, and the role of the operating system. The second chapter discusses the different addressing methods and machine program sequencing techniques used by various processors. The third chapter explains the design and operation of the processing unit, including instruction formats, instruction execution, control unit, microprogramming, and exception handling. The fourth chapter deals with the input-output organization, including buses, interrupts, direct memory access, input-output processors, and standard interfaces. The fifth chapter describes the memory hierarchy, including cache memory, virtual memory, memory management, and secondary storage devices. The sixth chapter covers the arithmetic operations performed by computers, including fixed-point and floating-point arithmetic, algorithms for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square root. The seventh chapter introduces the concept of pipelining, which improves the performance of processors by overlapping instruction execution stages. The eighth chapter presents examples of complex instruction set computer (CISC), reduced instruction set computer (RISC), and stack processors, namely the Motorola 680X0 and 683XX families, Intel 80X86 and Pentium families, ARM family, Sun Microsystems Sparc family, and DEC (Compaq) Alpha family. The ninth chapter surveys the various types of computer peripherals, such as keyboards, mice, displays, printers, scanners, modems, sound cards, and CD-ROM drives. The tenth chapter summarizes the trends and challenges in computer organization.
 
The book is suitable for a one-semester course in engineering or computer science programs. It has a good mix of hardware- and software-oriented topics. The book uses a number of extensive examples drawn from commercially available computers to illustrate the principles of computer organization. The book also includes exercises at the end of each chapter to test the students' understanding of the material. The book assumes that the students have some background in digital logic design and assembly language programming.
 
Computer Organization by Hamacher, Vranesic and Zaky is a comprehensive and well-written textbook that provides a solid foundation for students who want to learn about the inner workings of computers. It is also a useful reference for professionals who want to refresh their knowledge of computer organization.
