## How to Install Windows Evo 7 on Your Computer
 
If you have downloaded Windows Evo 7 from the link above and you want to install it on your computer, you will need to follow these steps:

1. Prepare a bootable USB drive with Windows Evo 7. You can use a tool like Rufus to create a bootable USB drive from the ISO file that you downloaded. Make sure you select the correct device and partition scheme for your system.
2. Backup your data and create a system restore point. Installing Windows Evo 7 will erase all the data on your hard drive, so you should backup your important files and settings before proceeding. You should also create a system restore point in case something goes wrong and you need to revert to your previous Windows version.
3. Boot from the USB drive and start the installation. Plug the USB drive into your computer and restart it. You may need to change the boot order in your BIOS or UEFI settings to boot from the USB drive. Once you boot from the USB drive, you will see the Windows Evo 7 setup screen. Click Install Now and accept the license agreement.
4. Select a custom installation and format your hard drive. When you reach the screen that asks you where do you want to install Windows, click Custom (advanced). You will see a list of partitions on your hard drive. Select each partition and click Delete until you have only one unallocated space. Then click New and Apply to create a new partition for Windows Evo 7. Make sure the partition is active and formatted as NTFS.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. The installation process will copy the files, expand them, install features and updates, and finish the setup. This may take some time depending on your system specifications. Once the installation is complete, you will be asked to enter a username and password, choose a color scheme, and customize some settings.
6. Enjoy Windows Evo 7 on your computer. You can now explore the features and benefits of Windows Evo 7 on your computer. You can also install additional drivers, software, and updates as needed.

Note: If you encounter any problems or errors during the installation process, you can try some of these solutions:

- If your computer does not recognize your hard drive or SSD, you may need to load a driver for it. You can download the driver from the manufacturer's website or use another computer to copy it to a USB drive. Then click Load Driver on the screen where you select where to install Windows and browse to the driver file.
- If your computer does not boot from the USB drive, you may need to disable Secure Boot or enable Legacy Boot in your BIOS or UEFI settings. You can access these settings by pressing a key such as F2, F10, F12, or Delete when you start your computer.
- If your computer does not start Windows Evo 7 after the installation, you may need to repair the boot sector or rebuild the boot configuration data (BCD). You can do this by booting from the USB drive again and clicking Repair Your Computer on the setup screen. Then select Troubleshoot, Advanced Options, Command Prompt and type these commands:

        bootrec /fixmbr
        bootrec /fixboot
        bootrec /rebuildbcd

- If you want to uninstall Windows Evo 7 and restore your previous Windows version, you can do this by using the system restore point that you created before installing Windows Evo 7. You can access this by booting from the USB drive again and clicking Repair Your Computer on the setup screen. Then select Troubleshoot, Advanced Options, System Restore and choose the restore point that you created.
